# IR_Remote_Raw

You can copy your remote controls with this library. Just you have to upload the `receiving_ir_raw.ino` to get the IR raw data of the RC and copy and paste the vals of received vals to the `sending_ir_raw.ino` and upload it to send the IR data.

This library also used by my project named "Eyes-HVAC" in my repository.
